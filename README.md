# Anki-avgEase
Anki 2.1 Add-On that iterates through each deck options group in your collection and sets the initial ease factor to the average ease factor of the mature cards (cards with intervals > 90 days) in that deck optons group.

Settings are calibrated each time a profile is loaded (at startup).

See Post: [Anki's Starting Ease Factor Settings](https://eshapard.github.io/anki/ankis-initial-ease-factor-setting.html) for the rationale behind this.

## Install
